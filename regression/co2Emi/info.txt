	SWB = Short wheelbase									
	LWB = Long wheelbase									
	EWB = Extended wheelbase									
Transmission	A = automatic

	E = ethanol (E85)									
	N = natural gas									
Fuel consumption	City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - the combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per imperial gallon (mpg)									
CO2 emissions	the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (in grams per kilometre) for combined city and highway driving									
CO2 rating	the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best)									
Smog rating	the tailpipe emissions of smog-forming pollutants rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best)

*Starting with the 2015 model year, vehicle manufacturers will use an improved testing procedure to determine the fuel consumption ratings of new light-duty vehicles. The new test methods result in higher fuel consumption ratings that are																				
more representative of everyday driving. To help you compare vehicles from different model years, the ratings for 1995-2014 vehicles have been adjusted to reflect the new test methods. Note that these  are approximate values that were 																				
generated from the original ratings, not from vehicle testing.

Fuel Consumption	City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per imperial gallon (mpg)																			
CO2 Emissions (g/km)	Estimated tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions (in grams per kilometre) are based on fuel type and the combined fuel consumption rating.
